[Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) is a tool that generates types for your GraphQL queries.
It's automatically generated Typescript types on development based on your GraphQL schemas.

Let's see how to setup a simple Codegen config for a Shopify Hydrogen project.

First, install the `@graphql-codegen/cli` and `@shopify/hydrogen-codegen` as dev dependencies with:

```bash
npm install @graphql-codegen/cli @shopify/hydrogen-codegen --save-dev
```

Then create a `codegen.ts` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```ts:codegen.ts
import type { CodegenConfig } from "@graphql-codegen/cli";
import { pluckConfig, preset, getSchema } from "@shopify/hydrogen-codegen";

export default {
  overwrite: true,
  pluckConfig,
  generates: {
    "storefront-api.generated.d.ts": {
      preset,
      schema: getSchema("storefront"),
      documents: [
        "./*.{ts,tsx}",
        "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
      ],
    }
  },
} as CodegenConfig;
```

This is the most basic config for Codegen to generate types for your GraphQL queries.
It's read the matching files in the `documents`, in this case, they are all files in the root and under the `app` directory that are `.ts` or `.tsx`.

The generated types are saved in the `storefront-api.generated.d.ts` file (you can change the name to whatever you want).

Now, update your `package.json` to add the `codegen` scripts:

```json:package.json
"scripts": {
  "codegen": "shopify hydrogen codegen",
  "dev": "shopify hydrogen dev --codegen",
  "build": "shopify hydrogen build --codegen",
}
```

The `@shopify/cli` and `@shopify/hydrogen` is needed also, but I assume you already have them installed cause this is a Hydrogen project.

Now you can run the `codegen` script to generate the types:

```bash
npm run codegen
```

The codegen will also automatically update the types when you run the `dev` or `build` scripts.

## Config for the new [Customer Account API](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/headless/building-with-the-customer-account-api/hydrogen)

If you are using the new [Customer Account API](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/headless/building-with-the-customer-account-api/hydrogen),
you will need to add a new config for the `customer-account` schema.

```ts:codegen.ts showLineNumbers {14,17-21}
import type { CodegenConfig } from "@graphql-codegen/cli";
import { pluckConfig, preset, getSchema } from "@shopify/hydrogen-codegen";

export default {
  overwrite: true,
  pluckConfig,
  generates: {
    "storefront-api.generated.d.ts": {
      preset,
      schema: getSchema("storefront"),
      documents: [
        "./*.{ts,tsx}",
        "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
        "!./app/routes/*.account*.{ts,tsx}", // Ignore account routes
      ],
    },
    "customer-account-api.generated.d.ts": {
      preset,
      schema: [getSchema("customer-account")],
      documents: ["./app/routes/*.account*.{ts,tsx}"],
    },
  },
} as CodegenConfig;
```

The config will check all queries in all account routes (files that match the `*.account*.{ts,tsx}` pattern)
and generate types for them in the `customer-account-api.generated.d.ts` file.

Remember to ignore the account routes in the `storefront-api.generated.d.ts` file also.

Happy coding! <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
