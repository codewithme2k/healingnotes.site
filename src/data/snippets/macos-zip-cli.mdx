MacOS has a built-in command to zip files and directories into a single file.

```bash
zip -r my-archive.zip <list of files or directories, separated by spaces>
```

For example, to zip a directory called `my-directory` and a file called `my-file.txt`, you can use the following command:

```bash
zip -r my-archive.zip my-directory my-file.txt
```

Happy zipping! <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
